## Fields Included

This data file is always produced, both when a transaction has one loan for one property and when a transaction has
multiple properties as collateral for one loan. The underwriter should provide “at contribution or static fields” within
the Property File to the Master Servicer and Certificate Administrator.

The Master Servicer should also furnish an updated file to the Certificate Administrator each successive month or as
required by the servicing agreement. The file data can change over time for many fields. Major file changes may
occur if a loan allows for substitution of different properties as collateral for a particular loan.
For the month of liquidation/release of a property, the Master Servicer will report all property level fields. For all
properties liquidated on or after the effective date of version 8.0 (9/30/16), starting with the reporting month after
liquidation/release, the Master Servicer will report certain property level fields until final pool liquidation. Master
servicers can elect to backfill properties liquidated prior to that date, although not required. These certain data fields
are as follows: P1, P2, P3, P4, P5 (updated monthly), P6, P7, P18 and P67. These fields should remain static as of
the month of liquidation/release.

For further discussion of issues affecting the Property File including defeasance, partial defeasance, substitution
and partial releases, please refer to Section X - Guidance for Specific Situations.
