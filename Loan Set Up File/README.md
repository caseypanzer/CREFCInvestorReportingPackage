## Fields Included






This data file is generally provided by the Master Servicer using information that is prepared by the
underwriter at the time of issuance. This file generally contains static information. 

The underwriter should provide the CREFC Loan Setup File and the “at contribution fields” or “static fields” in the CREFC Property File to the Master Servicer. In addition, the underwriter should provide the revenue and expense line items utilized to derive Net Operating Income (NOI) and Net Cash Flow (NCF) since these are needed to complete the
underwriting column of the OSAR. 

However, at times this does not happen, and the Master Servicer should create this file using loan files and whatever other information is available. 

The file may be made available to investors by the Certificate Administrator on its web site. The Loan Setup File will contain the majority of the loanlevel information found in the prospectus. Such information includes cut-off balance, original note rate, maturity date and general prepayment information, as well as “at contribution” financial data.
