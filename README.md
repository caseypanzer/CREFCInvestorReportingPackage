The seven data files are designed to provide standard formats that facilitate a smooth transfer of information from the Special Servicer to the Master Servicer, Master Servicer to the Certificate Administrator, and from the Certificate Administrator to the Investor (or user of this data). 

These standard data files are essential to support continued growth and liquidity within the secondary market. Standardization provides investors and rating agencies more consistent and reliable information, which is necessary so that an evaluation as to the probability of the timely receipt of interest and principal payments can be made.
