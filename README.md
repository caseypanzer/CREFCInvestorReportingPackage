# CRE Finance Council Investor Reporting Package
This package is designed as a standard information package to meet the needs of all types of CMBS investors. 

The package is seperated into two sections:
* [Investor Reports](https://github.com/caseypanzer/CREFCInvestorReportingPackage/tree/master/Investor%20Reports) - Reports which are made available to Investors on the Certificate Administrators websites
* [Servicer Templates](https://github.com/caseypanzer/CREFCInvestorReportingPackage/tree/master/Servicer%20Templates) - Standarized Templates to allow efficient transfer of information between Stakeholders

These standard data files are essential to support continued growth and liquidity within the secondary market. Standardization provides investors and rating agencies more consistent and reliable information, which is necessary so that an evaluation as to the probability of the timely receipt of interest and principal payments can be made. 

The pacakge is maintaned by the [CREFC Investor Reporting Package Committee](https://github.com/caseypanzer/CREFCInvestorReportingPackage/blob/master/irpCommitteeDirectory.md) consists of a representative group of Investors, Servicers, Trustees, Certificate Administrators, Underwriters and Rating Agencies.

## File Naming Best Practices
Standardization on file naming would provide consistency for Servicers, Certificate Administrator, Data Providers and Bond Holders.  As a result the CREFC IRP committee is recommending instituting a standard filing naming convention. Below is a tool to easily ensure compliance with the suggested naming conventions.
