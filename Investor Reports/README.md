## Supplemental Reports - 
Depending on the transaction, these reports are completed by the Master Servicer, Special Servicer, Certificate
Administrator or a combination of the parties, as appropriate. Oftentimes in a transaction, the reports are
shown as exhibits to the prospectus. Although information needs may vary widely from one investor to another, the
supplemental reports will provide them with a variety of ways to analyze and evaluate the current status of a
particular loan, property and/or the overall portfolio. Investors can request these reports from the Certificate
Administrator, although pursuant to some servicing agreements, Servicers may be required to publish this
information on their websites.
